# E-Governance System

Welcome to the E-Governance System repository! This project aims to digitize and streamline government services, making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient for both citizens and government employees. It uses a combination of Python (Flask), MySQL, and front-end technologies to deliver an intuitive web platform for managing various government services.

### **Key Features:**
- **Employee Dashboard:** Tools for managing services, CSCs, and data with secure login and access control.
